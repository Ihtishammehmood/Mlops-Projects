## About

This repository serves as a hub for my MLOps projects, where I experiment with different tools and frameworks to build scalable, reproducible, and maintainable machine learning pipelines. The primary focus is on leveraging ZenML for orchestration and BentoML for model serving, but I also explore other tools and best practices in the MLOps ecosystem.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects you can find in this repository:

1. **ZenML Pipelines**: Examples of end-to-end machine learning pipelines built using ZenML.
2. **BentoML Model Serving**: Tutorials and examples on how to serve machine learning models using BentoML.
3. **CI/CD for ML**: Implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for machine learning models.
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Setting up monitoring and logging for machine learning models in production.
5. **Experiment Tracking**: Using tools like MLflow or Weights & Biases for experiment tracking and model versioning.

## Technologies Used

- **ZenML**: For building and managing machine learning pipelines.
- **BentoML**: For serving and deploying machine learning models.
- **MLflow**: For experiment tracking and model management.
- **Docker**: For containerizing machine learning applications.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating containerized applications.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD automation.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: For monitoring and visualization.
